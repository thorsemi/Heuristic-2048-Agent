# Agent2048 â€” Heuristic + Expectimax

This is our implementation of the classic 2048 game with both manual and AI play capabilities.  
The AI uses a heuristic-based approach combined with the Expectimax algorithm to make optimal decisions.  
Includes a Pygame interface for playing manually or watching the AI play.
